This repository is a replication package associated with the paper entitled : **FlakyCat: Predicting Flaky Tests Categories using Few-Shot Learning**.
We provide all the code and data used for our experiments that could be easily replicated with the given notebooks.

# FlakyCat
FlakyCat is an approach for classifying the causes of flakiness, relying on the pre-trained model codebERT and Few Shot Learning based on Siamese networks.
